week 21/10/2022

What was done?
  *Talk to the other team leaders about what we had done this week
  *Use area 1 half done to program everything in java and in json, with a DTO.
  *We held a meeting on Tuesday 10/18 with the rest of teamleaders. I tried to teach them what a DTO was but in the end we agreed to do it in a json, 
   implementing it in a 3D model, for the ease of the other leaders of the teams.
  *We began to divide the tasks for each team 1 member.
  *We discussed about what program we shall use to create the diagrams for the next deliverable.
  *We did the UML class Diagram, and some sequence diagrams

What issues/blockers did we face?
  *discuss with the other leaders whether to do it in a DTO, or in a json, implementing it in a 3D model, 
   for the ease of the other leaders we have decided to do it in json
  *with my team we were also debating in which technology to work the diagrams, 
   if in visual paradigm or in starUML, personally we chose starUML, because it is 
   much easier to navigate and does not require any license activation
 
Goals for the next week
  *Distribute our roles
  *Try to finish much of the following practice.
  *Start thinking about the high-level overview of our team's deliverables internals and the automated testing. 
  *Create both the context diagram and the deployment diagram.
  *Ask the teacher a lot about what could be wrong and correct it

 week 28/10/2022

What was done?
	*we complete the uml class and deployment diagrams, of technical specification

What issues/blockers did we face?
	*we had problems about the deployment diagram, 
	 because we did not know how long it has to be, and detailed.
	 for that reason this week with the knowledge of the theoretical class and investigating on our own we made 
	 the deployment diagram and as it is the first time we do it we don't know if it is right, but finally we solve it
	*we had problems about the context diagrams, we don't know how to do it, because it is the first time we do it we don't know
 
Goals for the next week
	*finishing all the practice about technical specification
	*continue with the area 1 project and introduce a security program, as the teacher said in the last class session
